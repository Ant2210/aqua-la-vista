# ABOUT AQUA LA VISTA
## **INTRODUCTION**
Aqua La Vista - Saying Goodby to Boring Pools, Hello to Wild Swimming Excitement - is a mobile app designed to encourage exercise, socialisation, and the alleviation of depression and anxiety through the enjoyment of nature with a focus on wild swimming. 

The website provides information about the benefits of wild swimming for health and wellness, along with a search area where visitors can search for wild swimming events in their local area and/or around the UK and Ireland.

## **GOAL** 
The goal of our app is to educate and provide a resource for information and events on wild swimming.


‚û°Ô∏è **Problem Statement**

Post pandemic, mental health issues are on the rise and more people are leading sedentary lifestyles resulting in various health issues such as depression, anxiety, and a lack of physical exercise. The British Journal of child health produced a report in April 2021 on the reduced physical activity and increased sedentary behaviour of young people since 2020.

Additionally, people may not be aware of the benefits on wild swimming as a way to enjoy nature, socialise with others, make new friends, and improve overall well-being.

‚û°Ô∏è **Objectives**

The objectives of the Aqua La Vista app is to:

- Raise awareness: Educate users about the benefits of wild swimming, including physical exercise, fostering friendships, embracing nature and the positive impact that wild swimming can have on mental health.

- Encourage participation: We want to motivate our users to engage in wild swimming activities by providing information about suitable locations, safety guidelines, and group activities.

- Foster community: By providing the ability to search for local events and by featuring events and people who are active in the wild swimming community the app will support the ability to connect with like-minded individuals.

- Safety guidelines: The app provides safety guidelines including tips for beginners and advice on how to stay safe in different natural water environments through our Q&A section and articles.



### **Design Choices**

Our design focused on the search map as the main resource of the app using an API. Using the support of SERPAPI we were able to gain an additonal 400 search queries so the app can be tested to ensure it works.

In designing the website rather than go for the traditional blue (for ocean/water) we used primary colours which fall into the blue family including a strong purple, a lighter constrating blue and grey. These colours were selected to fit in with the hero image and other images on the app.

### **Colours**

Our design uses three main colours plus a text colour, with the main font being Monstserrat.
